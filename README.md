# Computational-Techniques-in-Finance
Some the models that I built for a class. These include, bonds, options, monte-carlo simulations etc. 
The programming language I used was Python. The projects/ files under this repository are assignments assigned in this class.
Credit goes to my professor, Aaron Stevens for being a great professor and for granting me the permission to post privately 
on Github.
